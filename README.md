### Hi there 👋

✍🏼 My specialization is creating UI with HTML / CSS, JavaScript, React. I have experience in backend building with NodeJS.

👷🏼‍♂️ I participated in educational projects in different roles - as a Front-end JS Developer and also as a Scrum Master. 

🌱 Currently, I am interested in learning other JavaScript frameworks and TypeScript. 

🧠 My goal is to participate in thought-provoking projects that will strengthen my knowledge as a Front-end or Full-stack JS Developer.

👅 English level: Advanced
